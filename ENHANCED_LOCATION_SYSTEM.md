# Enhanced Location System - Radius-Based Service Area Checking

## Overview

The location system has been enhanced to use **radius-based geographical checking** instead of simple text matching. This provides more accurate service area validation for Sectors 3, 4, and 5 in Bokaro Steel City, Jharkhand.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Accurate Coordinates**
- Updated with real coordinates from mapping services
- Sector 3: `23.669296, 86.151115`
- Sector 4: `23.671203, 86.1573709` 
- Sector 5: `23.6655, 86.1675`

### 2. **Radius-Based Checking**
- Each sector has a **2.5km service radius**
- Uses Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
- Checks if user location falls within any service sector's radius

### 3. **Enhanced Validation**
- **Primary**: Geocodes addresses to get exact coordinates
- **Fallback**: Text-based validation for basic checks
- **Detailed feedback**: Shows distance to nearest service sector

## New Features

### Service Area Information
```typescript
interface ServiceAreaInfo {
  isServiceable: boolean;
  nearestServiceSector: string | null;
  distanceToNearestService: number;
  allDistances: Array<{
    sector: string;
    distance: number;
    withinRadius: boolean;
  }>;
}
```

### Enhanced Functions
- `getServiceAreaInfo()` - Detailed service area analysis
- `findNearestServiceSector()` - Find closest serviceable sector
- `isLocationServiceable()` - Improved radius-based checking

## Configuration

### Service Sectors (in `constants.ts`)
```typescript
serviceSectors: [
  { 
    name: 'Sector 3', 
    pincode: '827003', 
    coordinates: { lat: 23.669296, lng: 86.151115 },
    radius: 2.5 // km
  },
  { 
    name: 'Sector 4', 
    pincode: '827004', 
    coordinates: { lat: 23.671203, lng: 86.1573709 },
    radius: 2.5 // km
  },
  { 
    name: 'Sector 5', 
    pincode: '827005', 
    coordinates: { lat: 23.6655, lng: 86.1675 },
    radius: 2.5 // km
  }
]
```

## Testing

### Test Page
Visit `/test-location-radius` to:
- Test address validation
- Get current location
- Run automated test suite
- View service area visualization

### Test Cases Covered
- ✅ Sector centers (should be serviceable)
- ✅ Points within 2.5km radius
- ❌ Points outside service radius
- ❌ Far away locations

## Components

### 1. **LocationInput** (Enhanced)
- Real-time validation with distance feedback
- Better error messages with specific distances
- Improved user experience

### 2. **ServiceAreaMap** (New)
- Visual representation of service areas
- User location status
- Distance information for each sector

### 3. **Test Page** (New)
- Comprehensive testing interface
- Automated test suite
- Real-time results

## Usage Examples

### Check if location is serviceable
```typescript
import { getServiceAreaInfo } from '@/lib/location';

const coordinates = { lat: 23.670, lng: 86.155 };
const serviceInfo = getServiceAreaInfo(coordinates);

if (serviceInfo.isServiceable) {
  console.log(`Serviceable! ${serviceInfo.distanceToNearestService}km from ${serviceInfo.nearestServiceSector}`);
} else {
  console.log(`Not serviceable. Closest sector is ${serviceInfo.distanceToNearestService}km away`);
}
```

### Validate address
```typescript
import { validateServiceArea } from '@/lib/location';

const result = await validateServiceArea("Sector 4, Bokaro Steel City");
console.log(result.isValid); // true/false
console.log(result.message); // Detailed feedback
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Coverage**: No more false positives/negatives from text matching
2. **Better UX**: Users get exact distance information
3. **Flexible**: Easy to adjust radius or add new sectors
4. **Reliable**: Works with GPS coordinates and address geocoding
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive test suite for validation

## Migration Notes

- Old text-based validation is kept as fallback
- Existing functionality remains compatible
- New features are additive, not breaking changes
- Enhanced error messages provide better user guidance

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Radius**: Different radius for different sectors
2. **Time-based Service**: Different coverage during peak hours
3. **Delivery Cost**: Distance-based pricing
4. **Route Optimization**: Integration with delivery routing
5. **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic service area adjustments

---

**Note**: The system now accurately tracks all areas within the specified radius of Sectors 3, 4, and 5, providing much better service area coverage than the previous text-matching approach.
